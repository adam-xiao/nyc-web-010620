## TTY-PROMPT
This is just a nice to have. I encourage you to practice learning how to learn by trying to incorporate this input/output library into your app. However, do not let it take too much of your time. If you want to just do input output using `gets.chomp`, that is fine too. The main thing you should be practicing in your Projects are:
* domain modeling
* ActiveRecord
  * Migrations
  * `has_many`, `belongs_to`
